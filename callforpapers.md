We invite all students, researchers, language designers and AI practitioners to take part in the first annual workshop on Advances in Programming Languages and Neurosymbolic Systems (AIPLANS), to be held Dec. 13th or 14th at NeurIPS 2021. AIPLANS welcomes submissions relevant to the fields of programming language and machine learning research. Authors who traditionally publish in venues such as SIGPLAN, SIGSOFT and other ACM venues are especially encouraged to submit work that may be relevant to the machine learning and reasoning community, provided that effort is taken to ensure its accessibility. Didactic submissions of outstanding clarity and reproducibility will be given special consideration.

When you are ready to submit, please do so using the following URL: [https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2021/Workshop/AIPLANS](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2021/Workshop/AIPLANS)

# Key Dates

AIPLANS has four important dates to keep in mind:

**Paper submission deadline**: Oct. 4th, 2021 AoE

**Reviews released**: Oct. 23rd, 2021

**Camera-ready deadline**: Dec. 10, 2021 AoE

**Workshop date**: Dec. 14th, 2021

Authors are strongly encouraged to submit early and often, as due to scheduling constraints, AIPLANS is unable to offer any extensions.

# Submission Guidelines

We invite papers that describe new or existing theory, methodology and/or applications related to automated learning and reasoning in the fields of programming languages and artificial intelligence. Submitted papers will be evaluated based on their (1) technical quality (2) clarity and (3) potential impact. For illustration, submissions may include the following topics:

* Neural program synthesis (e.g., search-based, syntax or execution-guided)
* Bayesian program learning (e.g., higher-order probabilistic programming)
* Neural-symbolic reasoning (e.g., automated program verification and testing)
* Neural program extraction (e.g., procedural or relational knowledge distillation)
* Induction of formal languages (e.g., grammar inference, automata extraction)
* Natural language programming (e.g., machine teaching, programming by example)
* Logic programming (e.g., tabled LP, ILP, constraint programming et al.)
* New programming languages for reasoning (e.g., LF/Twelf, HOL, miniKanren, L∃∀N, et al.)
* New programming languages for learning (e.g., Dex, Hasktorch, Torch-Struct, et al.)
* Programing language theory (e.g., type theory, category theory, denotational semantics)
* Satisfiability checking and symbolic computation (e.g. SAT/SMT solving, boolean circuits)
* Logic and equational reasoning (e.g., λ-calculus, π-calculus, tensor and combinator calculi)
* Inference algorithms (e.g., backpropagation, belief propagation, survey propagation et al.)

Submissions are limited to four NeurIPS-formatted pages, plus unlimited additional pages for references, appendices and supplementary material (e.g. containing proof details). Other materials, such as multimedia or source code may be shared by linking to an anonymized Git repository, e.g., https://anonymous.4open.science/. Reviewers will be allowed but not obliged to consider supplementary material.

Paper should be formatted according to the follow LaTeX template: [https://aiplans.github.io/assets/cfp/aiplans2021template.zip](https://aiplans.github.io/assets/cfp/aiplans2021template.zip)

Submitted papers are to be evaluated in a single round of double-blind peer-review, with no author rebuttal necessary. All accepted papers will be presented at the workshop as either contributed talks or as posters. Outstanding submissions will be considered for oral presentation as a contributed talk.

AIPLANS permits dual submission to another conference, journal or workshop during the AIPLANS review cycle.

Please direct any questions about the above information to the [AIPLANS organizers](/organizers) who may be contacted via email: `aiplans2021 at gmail dot com`.

# Confidentiality

AIPLANS is committed to protecting the anonymity of its authors and reviewers. We will use OpenReview to host discussions, however reviewers’ identities will remain anonymous. Any papers divulging information that could reasonably be used to identify the authors’ names or affiliations will be subject to desk rejection. AIPLANS advises against advertising preprints on social media or elsewhere while under review and preprints must not be explicitly identified as an AIPLANS submission at any time during the review period. Reviews will not be made public after the discussion period ends.
