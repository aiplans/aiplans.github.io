If accepted, AIPLANS will announce its CFP and pursue contributions from the broader ML/PL community shortly thereafter. Two months later, the CFP will close on Sept. 24th. This deadline may be extended to no later than Oct. 1st, depending on the volume of submissions received, leaving sufficient time for referees and program chairs to leave feedback. Authors will be notified of acceptance no later than Oct. 22nd. We intend to finalize the schedule and coordinate presentation logistics between Nov. and Dec. 14th. Those who wish to prerecord talks will be given an opportunity to do so. The final workshop will consist of prerecorded and live talks with Q\&A, followed by a moderated panel, and virtual poster session hosted on GatherTown. Further details about schedule and logistics will be made available, pending acceptance.
