\title{Advances in Programming Languages\\ and Neurosymbolic Systems (AIPLANS)}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

        \textbf{Tagline:} AIPLANS: a new workshop at NeurIPS 2021 fusing ML with programming theory to create neurosymbolic program-writing machines!  \url{https://aiplans.github.io} % Are you curious whether machines can write programs that are both sound and interpretable? Come check out AIPLANS, a new workshop on domain-specific languages for learning and synthetic reasoning, to be hosted at NeurIPS 2021!
    \end{abstract}


    % A title and a brief description of the workshop topic and content.
    Neural information processing systems have benefited tremendously from the availability of programming languages and frameworks for automatic differentiation (AD). Not only do NeurIPS benefit from \textbf{programming languages} for automatic inference but can also be considered as a language in their own right, consisting of differentiable and stochastic primitives. Combined with neural language models, these systems are increasingly capable of generating symbolic programs a human programmer might write in a high-level language. Developing \textbf{neurosymbolic systems} for automatic program synthesis requires insights from both statistical learning and programming languages.

    AIPLANS invites all researchers working towards the same purpose in these two communities to build on common ground. Our workshop is designed to be as inclusive as possible towards researchers engaged in building programming languages and neurosymbolic systems of various forms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Machine learning researchers} would present advances in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and program synthesis. AIPLANS would afford these participants an opportunity to learn about new automatic programming languages and techniques for inference.
        \item \textbf{Language designers} would be able to give tutorials on newly developed software such as JAX, DEX, PyTorch and their latest features. AIPLANS would give them an opportunity to engage their users and stay in touch with the community's needs and research directions.
        \item \textbf{PL theorists} would present fundamental theory behind the design of automatic programming languages, such as functional, semiring or array programming. At AIPLANS, they would gain a better understanding of practical research problems the ML community is tackling.
        \item \textbf{Probabilistic programming researchers} would present advances in, e.g., Bayesian program synthesis and neurosymbolic systems. AIPLANS would provide a opportunity for them to understand how their work bridges the divide between PL theory and practice.
    \end{itemize}

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    While other workshops have explored these themes separately, few have highlighted the synergies between them. As these fields have traditionally been segregated, rediscovery of ideas was common. AD itself was invented a half dozen times over the last century and research continues to reveal unexpected connections to implicit differentiation, bilevel optimization, optimal control, stochastic processes and differential equations.  Semiring programming has existed for many decades and shares deep connections to reinforcement learning, structured inference and probabilistic programming.

    Likewise, many recently-transplanted ideas in machine learning are catechism in the programming language literature.  For example, functional and type-safe programming are lingua franca in PL circles but relatively new to Python, the primary language used in machine learning.  The duality between code and data is well-known in PL under the aegis of homoiconicity. PL theory has thought carefully about categorical semantics, process calculi, linear logic, type theory and other deeply useful concepts which remain, to this day, largely unfamiliar to the machine learning community.

    % In contrast, PL has long wrestled with the distinction between intensional and extensional representation, a distinction which the statistical learning community has long since reconciled through model-based learning and approximation theory.
    \pagebreak
    Other areas where the interaction could be fruitful are tools for equivalence, proof search and metrics. A deeper understanding of programming language semantics are largely missing from neural program synthesis discussions. The connection between various forms of message passing in concurrent systems and neural science merits further investigation. New language models could enable more effective tools for natural language and assistive programming. While some of these topics remain greenfield research topics, many connections are known, but yet-to-be-translated textbook knowledge.

    \end{figure}

    Applying techniques from programmable inference to transform and generate programs, and adapting insights gained developing those programs to drive innovation in higher-order AD and probabilistic programming is a virtuous cycle. As researchers grow more accustomed to outsourcing low-level reasoning tasks to automatic programming systems, we anticipate cooperation between automatic and synthetic programming will continue to increase.  A joint workshop such as the one put forward in this proposal could help to facilitate yet-unrealized research connections among neighboring fields.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


    % Much work remains.
    % Similar domain-specific languages have shown progress automating inference in other logical disciplines, such as belief nets, proof nets, and related message passing schemes on tree- and graph-structured data.

    % For example, functional and type-safe programming are lingua franca in PL circles but relatively new to Python, the primary language used in machine learning. PL theory has thought deeply about categorical semantics, concurrency, process calculi, linear logic, privacy and other deeply useful concepts which remain, to this day, mostly unfamiliar in the machine learning community.  Similarly, the programming language community too, has its blind spots. PL could take a page from structured inference and propagation algorithms as a medium for distributed computation.

    % In exchange, we believe a great deal of progress can be achieved, in particular, between automatic and synthetic programming. For illustration, we include the following incomplete list of topics:

    % \begin{itemize}
    % \item Differentiable programming / algorithmic differentiation
    % \item Probabilistic programming / statistical inference
    % \item Dynamic programming / reinforcement learning
    % \item Program induction / program synthesis
    % \item Functional programming / $\lambda$-calculus
    % \item Semiring programming / message passing
    % \item Array programming / linear algebra
    % \item Meta-programming / meta-learning
    % \item Logic programming / Relational programming
    % \end{itemize}



    % A description of special requirements and technical needs.
    % TODO




    % A list of invited speakers, if applicable, with an indication of which ones have already agreed and which are indicative.
    % We plan to invite four keynote speakers.  Three system developers, and one programming language theoretician.  TODO:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item
    % \end{itemize}







    % An account of the efforts made to ensure diversity of the organizers and speakers (WiML, Black in AI, and LXAI directories, among others, may be a useful resource). Also an account of any efforts to include diverse participants (e.g., via mentoring, subsidies, or the wording and topics in the CFP).
    AIPLANS will be a single-day workshop hosted online, enabling an economically and geographically diverse audience to participate. Talks will be hosted in English, following the standard format of oral presentations and panel discussions, to be concluded with a virtual poster session. Proceedings will be non-archival. Outside of standard videoconferencing and SlidesLive assistance, we anticipate no other technical requirements. If accepted, we expect to receive a hundred or so participants, including speakers and workshop submitters, based on attendance at similarly-themed workshops in prior years.
    % An estimate of the number of attendees.

    Those who traditionally publish in venues such as SIGPLAN and SIGSOFT are encouraged to submit work that may be relevant to the machine learning and reasoning community, provided that effort is taken to ensure its accessibility. Special consideration will be given to didactic submissions of outstanding clarity. Further information, including evaluation criteria, examples of relevant literature, deadlines and workshop logistics will be made available in a timely manner.

    %   By submitting a workshop proposal, workshop organizers commit to notifying those who submit contributions (including talks and posters) to the workshop of their acceptance status before Oct 22, 2021. A timeline should be included in the proposal that will allow for this.

    If accepted, AIPLANS will announce its CFP and pursue contributions from the broader ML/PL community shortly thereafter. Two months later, the CFP will close on Sept. 24\textsuperscript{th}. This deadline may be extended to no later than Oct. 1\textsuperscript{st}, depending on the volume of submissions received, leaving sufficient time for referees and program chairs to leave feedback. Authors will be notified of acceptance no later than Oct. 22\textsuperscript{nd}. We intend to finalize the schedule and coordinate presentation logistics between Nov. and Dec. 14\textsuperscript{th}. Those who wish to prerecord talks will be given an opportunity to do so. The final workshop will consist of prerecorded and live talks with Q\&A, followed by a moderated panel, and virtual poster session hosted on GatherTown. Further details about schedule and logistics will be made available, pending acceptance at: \url{https://aiplans.github.io/}.

    AIPLANS is an equal-opportunity workshop that celebrates cultural, linguistic, ethnic and intellectual diversity in all forms. Not only are we committed to nondiscrimination on the basis of, e.g., race, creed, age, gender, orientation, physical or mental handicap, but also aim to encourage individuals from other disadvantaged and underrepresented socioeconomic backgrounds to participate. Should our workshop be accepted, scholarships covering the cost of registration will be extended for those who wish to attend but would otherwise be unable to do so due to financial hardship.
